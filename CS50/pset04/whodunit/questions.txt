0.  BMP : ~ (fluent), GIF : 256, JPEG : 16*10^3, PNG : 16*10^3 + transparency
1.  GIF
2.  With lossless compression, every single bit of data that was originally in the file remains after the file is uncompressed. Lossy compression reduces a file by permanently eliminating certain information, especially redundant information.
3.  GIF, BMP, PNG
4.  We just loose a link to data, not data itself.
5.  Format "empty" disk space or fill it with random variables.
6.  A header file that standardizes integers (exact-width) across different systems.
7.  It’s easier to have aliases to use interchangeably for explicit fixed width integers. Specifies the number of bytes because one system an int might be a long in another.
8.  1 4 4 2
9.  0x42 0x4d
10. bfSize is the size of the bitmap file in bytes. biSize is the number of bytes required by the structure. (BITMAPINFOHEADER)
11. If biHeight is negative, indicating a top-down DIB, biCompression must be either BI_RGB or BI_BITFIELDS. Top-down DIBs cannot be compressed.
12. biBitCount
13. Because a limit of disk space can be reached or program have no permissions to create a file.
14. Because you didn't use array. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
15. 3
16. Sets the file position indicator for the file stream to the value pointed to by offset.
17. How you set the offset to be relative to the current position indicator instead of the start or end.
18. Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
